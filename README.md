<b> Current Event Chat Bot </b>

Design and implement an architecture for a small-scale

LLM app that takes a user's query about current events and outputs the 10 most relevant news articles in a text format. Your app will have access to the following data sources:

Internet: Your app should be able to perform a web search and retrieve relevant results to enrich its answers using Google's Serp. File archive: Your app should also be able to source data from a set of archived newspapers stored on disk, using Guardian. For the demo, you can use any public dataset of press/newspaper archives available online.
